# Chess Game 

This project is an implementation of a basic chess game using Java Swing. The game features a graphical user interface that allows players to select and move pieces on the board, and includes basic game rules such as checking, capturing, and castling.

## Getting Started

To run the game, clone the repository to your local machine and compile and run the `Main.java` class using your preferred Java compiler.

## Playing the Game

To play the game, simply click on a piece to select it, and then click on a highlighted square to move the piece to that location. If a move is invalid, the selected piece will return to its original location and an error message will be displayed. 

The game includes basic chess rules such as checking, capturing, and castling. If a player's king is in check, the game will display a warning message. If a player's king is in checkmate, the game will display a message declaring the winner.

## Customization

The game includes several customizable parameters that can be adjusted in the `Chess` constructor in the `Main` class, including:

- `frameSize`: the size of the game board in pixels
- `player1Name` and `player2Name`: the names of the two players
- `Theme`: we have two aesome themes (Dark - Green)

Additional customization options can be added by modifying the source code.
